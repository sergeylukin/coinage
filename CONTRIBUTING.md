## Guideline

Contributing is absolutely encouraged, but a few things should be taken into
account:

  - Always test any bug-fixes or changes with [unit testing][]

  - When adding or changing a feature, make sure to write a **new**
    [unit test][unit-testing]

  - When creating pull requests

    - make sure to create useful/verbose PR messages

    - don't be afraid to squash your commits

    - rebase onto the parent's upstream branch before pushing your remote
